Write a class RecentCounter to count recent requests.

It has only one method: ping(int t), where t represents some time in milliseconds.

Return the number of pings that have been made from 3000 milliseconds ago until now.

Any ping with time in [t - 3000, t] will count, including the current ping.

It is guaranteed that every call to ping uses a strictly larger value of t than before.





#code
class RecentCounter:

    def __init__(self):
    
        
        self.time = []

    def ping(self, t: int) -> int:
        
        n = len(self.time)
        
        
        timer = 0
        for i in range(n):
            timer  = t - self.time[n - i - 1] 
            if timer > 3000:
                self.time = self.time[n-i:]
                self.time.append(t)
                return len(self.time)
            
            
        self.time.append(t)
        return len(self.time)


# Your RecentCounter object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = RecentCounter()
# param_1 = obj.ping(t)
